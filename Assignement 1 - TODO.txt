TODO-List Exercise 1
---------------------

* PROBLEM 1
- Calculate magnetic susceptibility using fluctuations @ T>T_c && T<T_c
- Plot magn. susc. VS T and find T_c(L) by finding the max
- Plot T_c(L) VS 1/T and find T_c(inf)
(- Evaluate M VS T near T_c and find critical exponent beta)
- Calculate magnetization per spin m(T) for system size L below Tc(L), and then fitting it to m ∼ (Tc(L) − T)**β on log-log

* PROBLEM 2
- For same system sizes and temps, find the magn. susc. from fluctuations using the Wolff algo

* PROBLEM 3
- Design a Wolff-like algo for next-NN and show detailed balance is maintained
- Show how to design a Wolff algo for 2D-Ising in magnetic field
- Show how to design a Wolff algo & Metropolis alog for XY-Model
- Show how to construct a heat bath algorithm for the q-state Potts model in two dimensions
- Observe the difference between the transition for a 3 & 5-state Potts-model

* PROBLEM 4
- Show that the equations are balanced
- Sum up equations to get a rate equations, what are the differences with the original
- What should be P(N) so that the rate equations are the same
- Solve the equation using the generating function and its derivative
- Explain why if <N> is small, the rate equation results are not the same as for the master equation
